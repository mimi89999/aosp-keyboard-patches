# Another AOSP keyboard

There are many keyboards based on AOSP keyboards like Simple Keyboard, OpenBoard or the dozen keyboards in the dozen Android custom ROMs. None of them suited my needs. Worse. All of them have bugs, but they have a different subset of bugs and fixes from one fork are rarely applied or ported to other forks. I hope that with the patchy format of this repo it will be easy to pull changes from AOSP and it's fork and these pathes can be easily applied to other keyboards.
